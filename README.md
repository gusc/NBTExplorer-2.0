| Windows XP or later, .NET Framework 2.0 or later. | NBTExplorer 2.0 is compatible with recent Mono runtimes, at least 2.6 or later. Minimally, your system needs the `mono-core` and `mono-winforms` packages, or whatever package set is equivalent.  | A separate Mac version with a native UI is available.  All Mono dependencies are included within the app package. Minimum supported OS is OSX 10.8 Mountain Lion, but it may run on versions as early as Snow Leopard. |

The Windows version of NBTExplorer 2.0 can still be used if the Mac version does not work.  You will need to install the
